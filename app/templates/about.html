		<h1 style="text-align: center">History</h1>
		<br>
		<p style="text-indent: 40px">
			Brain Arts Organization began as Boston Hassle, a project formed in 2009 when co-founders Sam Potrykus and Dan Shea joined  forces and began leveraging their combined 10+ years of booking around Greater Boston. The foundation of the organization at that time was the founders’ shared passion for all-ages programming and artists whose work defied categorization. Shea already had a blog for his show-booking operation and label Bodies Of Water Arts And Crafts and combined with Potrykus’ Boston Compass newspaper (then a free, monthly zine distributed all over Boston) they formed BostonHassle.com and then Boston Hassle Shows in 2011. After developing a significant following and volunteer base, Boston Hassle obtained 501(c)(3) status and rebranded as Brain Arts Organization, Inc. (BAO) in 2013. A year later the group started the Brain Arts Market (then known as the Black Market Flea), a bi-monthly market featuring original artwork and handmade leather, glass, and ceramic goods, along with second-hand and reclaimed items. Its scale and focus on independent non-commercial artisans has made BAM one of the most highly-attended markets in the area, often drawing over 1,000 visitors per event.
		</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 40px">
			Between 2014 and 2017 the group continued to commit countless volunteer hours to highlighting music and art shows as well as organizing festivals and branching out into arts advocacy. The addition of Molly Dower (accountant) and Emma Leavitt (Creative Director) propelled the group to a new level of professionalism and sustainability. While in the pursuit of their own physical space,Potrykus recalled a space he had been to before, then called the Howard Art Project (HAP) down in Dorchester, where some friends had started a studio and gallery space. After reaching out to book Mourning A BlkStar (Cleveland) for a Hassle show, he discovered that his friends who ran the HAP (and also recently renamed it Dorchester Art Project) were looking for someone to take over the lease.  With the help of Anya Smolnikova, Potrykus, Dower and their fellow volunteers officially took over operations at DAP in winter of 2017.

			In the past 3 years Dorchester Art Project (DAP) has blossomed into a community arts center complete with 14 artist studios, a gallery and exhibition space, storefront, co-working space and an intimate performance hall. DAP programming includes art exhibitions, music performances, monthly open mics, artist-in-residency programs, and after school art education programs. All DAP events are drug-free, all-ages, and open to the public. Despite (or perhaps because of) their unique and unorthodox management structure, DAP was named the 2019 Intimate Live Music Venue of the Year by the Boston Music Awards. Running DAP has taught Brain Arts Org so much about not only their mission and their opportunity to serve marginalized artists but also about the value in committing to those artists and individuals in Dorchester specifically. With the addition of Emma Leavitt as co-director on the board, BAO has become a more adaptive and mission-centered org with a commitment to learning about their hyperlocal community, and how to be an inclusive and equitable arts nonprofit.
		</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 40px">
			The journey continues into the new decade with several significant changes to the nonprofit. For one, in the fall of 2019 BAO dropped the Boston Hassle blog as a project and have re-focused their show booking and blogging efforts on the mission that guides them. BAO volunteers continue to produce a music and culture blog (brain-arts.org) and book all-ages concerts all over Greater Boston (including the first Damo Suzuki appearance in Boston in over 10 years). In February 2020 Brain Arts Organization welcomed Marc Drinkwater and Dorchester native Jelani Haynes to the board as well as new accountant Dorchester native Ava Fields to the BAO staff. However BAO’s strategic plan was upended due to the global coronavirus pandemic and the team was forced to change gears into survival mode.

		</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 40px">
			Right now, Brain Arts Organization’s mission is being tested as we respond to the COVID-19 crisis. In the midst of significant growth, increasing our capacity and continuing to put Dorchester voices as the forefront of the decision-making, this will be a critical time for our org to prove that our mission and community are worth supporting. Please give what you can HERE to help our small staff and our artists survive this pandemic so that we can continue our work into the future, where true sustainability for our culture will be achieved.
