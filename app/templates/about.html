        (10/22/20) A Message from Brain Arts Organization Co-Directors:
      </h4>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
        Greetings BAO fam and supporters. I often explain our work at Brain Arts Organization as building the ladder as we climb it, while simultaneously working to dismantle the ladder of the nonprofit industrial complex. Starting September 1st a significant rung was added to our ladder towards sustainability. We secured a month-to-month lease on the space downstairs from DAP, a beautiful storefront space which more than doubles our square footage. The community response was unbelievably supportive; we put in well over 500 hours of volunteer work cleaning, painting and transforming the space. But now the real work begins. It’s going to take an extraordinary effort to cultivate sustainability in this new venture. So far we have launched a storefront selling the work of local artists, a communal workspace with donated art supplied and a beautiful mural in the basement by Dorchester-based aerosol artist  Jeremy “Sobek” Harrison. Next, an exhibition/photo/video space, more workshops, more studios, and space for music and dance rehearsals. The potential is enormous and we encourage you to plug in to the process and volunteer, donate and support. We are excited to build this with you!! Follow our staff developments below as we continue to hire local artists to share the decision making power and responsibilities of our nonprofit. It’s going to take all of us.
        <br /><br />
        - Sam Potrykus & Emma Leavitt

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">History</h1>
    <br />
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
      Brain Arts Organization began as Boston Hassle, a project formed in 2009
      when co-founders Sam Potrykus and Dan Shea joined forces and began
      leveraging their combined 10+ years of booking around Greater Boston. The
      foundation of the organization at that time was the founders’ shared
      passion for all-ages programming and artists whose work defied
      categorization. Shea already had a blog for his show-booking operation and
      label Bodies Of Water Arts And Crafts and combined with Potrykus’ Boston
      Compass newspaper (then a free, monthly zine distributed all over Boston)
      they formed BostonHassle.com and then Boston Hassle Shows in 2011. After
      developing a significant following and volunteer base, Boston Hassle
      obtained 501(c)(3) status and rebranded as Brain Arts Organization, Inc.
      (BAO) in 2013. A year later the group started the Brain Arts Market (then
      known as the Black Market Flea), a bi-monthly market featuring original
      artwork and handmade leather, glass, and ceramic goods, along with
      second-hand and reclaimed items. Its scale and focus on independent
      non-commercial artisans has made BAM one of the most highly-attended
      markets in the area, often drawing over 1,000 visitors per event.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
      Between 2014 and 2017 the group continued to commit countless volunteer
      hours to highlighting music and art shows as well as organizing festivals
      and branching out into arts advocacy. The addition of Molly Dower
      (accountant) and Emma Leavitt (Creative Director) propelled the group to a
      new level of professionalism and sustainability. While in the pursuit of
      their own physical space,Potrykus recalled a space he had been to before,
      then called the Howard Art Project (HAP) down in Dorchester, where some
      friends had started a studio and gallery space. After reaching out to book
      Mourning A BlkStar (Cleveland) for a Hassle show, he discovered that his
      friends who ran the HAP (and also recently renamed it Dorchester Art
      Project) were looking for someone to take over the lease. With the help of
      Anya Smolnikova, Potrykus, Dower and their fellow volunteers officially
      took over operations at DAP in winter of 2017.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
      In the past 3 years Dorchester Art Project (DAP) has blossomed into a
      community arts center complete with 14 artist studios, a gallery and
      exhibition space, storefront, co-working space and an intimate performance
      hall. DAP programming includes art exhibitions, music performances,
      monthly open mics, artist-in-residency programs, and after school art
      education programs. All DAP events are drug-free, all-ages, and open to
      the public. Despite (or perhaps because of) their unique and unorthodox
      management structure, DAP was named the 2019 Intimate Live Music Venue of
      the Year by the Boston Music Awards. Running DAP has taught Brain Arts Org
      so much about not only their mission and their opportunity to serve
      marginalized artists but also about the value in committing to those
      artists and individuals in Dorchester specifically. With the addition of
      Emma Leavitt as co-director on the board, BAO has become a more adaptive
      and mission-centered org with a commitment to learning about their
      hyperlocal community, and how to be an inclusive and equitable arts
      nonprofit.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
      The journey continues into the new decade with several significant changes
      to the nonprofit. For one, in the fall of 2019 BAO dropped the Boston
      Hassle blog as a project and have re-focused their show booking and
      blogging efforts on the mission that guides them. BAO volunteers continue
      to produce a music and culture blog (brain-arts.org) and book all-ages
      concerts all over Greater Boston (including the first Damo Suzuki
      appearance in Boston in over 10 years). In February 2020 Brain Arts
      Organization welcomed Marc Drinkwater and Dorchester native Jelani Haynes
      to the board as well as new accountant Dorchester native Ava Fields to the
      BAO staff. However BAO’s strategic plan was upended due to the global
      coronavirus pandemic and the team was forced to change gears into survival
      mode.
